# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
For this project: I chose option number 2. I used “Causes of Death - Our World In Data” data for my project.
The goals were to answer the following questions:
1)What is the most common cause of death?
2)Which country suffers the most? Why, if possible?

## Process
### Download the data to Tableau.
### Analyze the data and try to understand the trend.
###  Made some data type changes to help me with analyzing.
### Create multiple graphs for different causes of death to find a trend.

## Results
For this project: I chose option number 2. I used “Causes of Death - Our World In Data” data for my project.
The goals were to answer the following questions:

	1)What is the most common cause of death?
	2)Which country suffers the most? Why, if possible?

Data showed that cause of death can be divided into three groups:

	•Certain causes of death increased over time.
	•Certain causes of death decreased over time.
	•Certain causes of death that didn’t change over time.

By creating a table with with highest number cause of death, a conclusion was: 

	1)The number one cause of death is cardiovascular disease.
	2)Diabetes mellitus comes second.
	3)China and India are the leading countries for the number of mortalities.
 
 I made a bar graph showing the following:
The graph showed 20% of cardiovascular disease mortalities are in China, and 10% of cardiovascular disease mortalities are in India.
Diabetes mellitus is the second cause of death, but is much lower compared to cardiovascular disease.

This led to a new question: 
Are these numbers high because Cardiovascular disease is a problem in China and India, or because China and India have a higher population?
I wanted to look at the numbers from a different lens. Based on the World Bank categories of the countries:

	1)High income countries
	2)High-middle income countries
	3)Low-middle income countries
	4)Low income  countries

Creating a new continuous line graph:
It is evident that the countries that are classified as upper-middle and lower-middle income have the highest rate of cardiovascular diseases.
The data was collected in 2019 and at that time, China and India fell under these categories.
From this data we can clearly say that cardiovascular diseases is not prominent in China and India, however, it seems that way because China and India have a large population.
## Challenges 
The data only has two tables. One of the tables could have been divided into multiple tables and that would make the work easier.
Using Tableau was challenging at first.

## Future Goals
Make more detailed tables from this data and create more analysis from it. Create a new column which will contain the percentage of the mortality for each cause in each country. That will give a better picture about how severe this illness is in a particular country.
